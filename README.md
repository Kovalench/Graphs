# Graphs
This project is an educational C++ implementation of classical graph algorithms, including traversal, minimum spanning tree construction, shortest path algorithms, and maximum flow algorithms. Additionally, the project generates visualizations in Graphviz (.dot and .png) for each algorithm.
