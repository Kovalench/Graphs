# Graphs
This project is an educational C++ implementation of classical graph algorithms, including traversal, minimum spanning tree construction, shortest path algorithms, and maximum flow algorithms. Additionally, the project generates visualizations in Graphviz (.dot and .png) for each algorithm.

Features

The program includes the following groups of algorithms:

1. Basic Graph Traversal (Unweighted Graphs)

  Breadth-First Search (BFS)

  Depth-First Search (DFS)

2. Minimum Spanning Trees (Weighted Undirected Graph)

  Kruskal's Algorithm (with DSU)

  Prim's Algorithm

3. Shortest Path Algorithms

  Bellman–Ford Algorithm

  Dijkstra's Algorithm

  Floyd–Warshall Algorithm

  Johnson’s Algorithm

4. Maximum Flow Algorithms (Directed Graph)

  Ford–Fulkerson Algorithm

  Edmonds–Karp Algorithm

Technologies Used:

  C++

  Graphviz for visualization (circo layout engine)

  Standard Template Library (STL)
